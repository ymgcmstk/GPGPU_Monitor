# GPGPU Monitor
## How To Use
Rewrite COMMON_SERVERS (and PERSONAL_SERVERS if you need) on `settings.py`.
Then run `python gpgpu_monitor.py` on screen.
You can check GPGPUs by seeing `page/index.html`.

I'm sorry but I have never checked whether this works on another environment, so you may have to modify this repository.
